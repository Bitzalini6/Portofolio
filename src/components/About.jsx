              Hello, hope you doing alright !<br></br> I am Gabriel Giurca, nice
              to meet you. Please take a look around.

              I describe myself as a responsible and loyal person, determined to
              perform and I enjoy development because of the satisfaction I get
              by overcoming challenges. I am motivated by the opportunity that
              software provides to positively impact the life of an individual,
              and the world as a whole. Coding and personal development are my
              passion and I am looking forward to bringing that passion to a
              full-time role.
